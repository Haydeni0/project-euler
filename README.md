# project-euler
This repository contains code for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems (questions).
The list of 

The purpose of going through Project Euler is to use interesting and progressively more difficult programming/logical challenges in order to develop skills in C++, data structures and more advanced programming concepts.

Question 1 was the first script I ever wrote in C++.

## Layout

### Questions

Each question subfolder contains a ```main.ext``` file that contains code (and any additional files such as provided txt files) that will give the solution for the particular problem. The directory ```./include``` contains libraries where code can be placed that may be reused between questions.

### MakeFolders

A simple script that made the lengthy question directories template. Careful about this as there are no safety precautions.

The whole directory structure may be changed in the future.
